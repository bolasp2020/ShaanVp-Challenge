An implementation of an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model with a Safety Stock buffer, and inventory Reorder Point. Or in layman terms - how much inventory to hold, when to buy more, and how much.

This repository contains two files:

1) A .Rmd file which is an R notebook for generating html. The .Rmd file can be ran with RStudio for the R language but what you really want is...
2) the html file which is the final output of the R program. Download it and open it up in any modern browser. It is a literate-programming notebook which walks you through how to model inventory for e-commerce businesses.
